Traditional students meet with us every weekend. Day, time, location, duration, and rate of lessons are kept the same each week.  


Drop-in Sessions
At Bright Stars, we’re dedicated to supporting any student committed to reaching their academic goals. Whether it's just a handful of sessions or ongoing support, if we can make a difference, we’re here to help. Our tutors are flexible and available to take on drop-in students, depending on their schedules. Explore more about our tutors and check their availability here.


In-Person
The location for in-person lessons will be arranged in advance between you, the Bright Stars admin team, and your assigned tutor. Common meeting spots include local coffee shops, libraries, or student homes. Please remember to bring all necessary learning materials to your lesson.


Online
We provide online support through various platforms. Connect with us via WhatsApp, Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams for convenient and flexible learning. 


National Benchmark Test
Many of our tutors are experienced in preparing students for the National Benchmark Test (NBT), which plays a crucial role in university admissions. We understand the unique challenges this test presents, from its specific format to the diverse academic areas it covers. Our tutors have a strong background in these areas, having studied relevant topics at post-secondary institutions. We're here to help you navigate the NBT with confidence and work towards achieving the best possible results. Reach out today and let’s start preparing for success!


Test Prep
Need a quick boost before your test or exam? We offer flexible, one-time tutoring sessions to help you prepare effectively. Just let us know the subject and test date, and we’ll connect you with a tutor who can guide you through key concepts, practice questions, and study strategies. Whether you need last-minute clarification or structured revision, we’re here to help you feel confident on exam day. Contact us today to get started!

 

Private And Group Lessons
The majority of our students prefer private lessons, allowing for a fully personalized learning experience. Each session is tailored to your specific needs—whether it's tackling difficult topics, completing assignments, or preparing for upcoming assessments.

For those interested in group lessons, we can arrange sessions if both students are at a similar level and pace in the subject. Contact us for details on pricing and scheduling options!
